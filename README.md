 8/21-8/24: Week 1
  We worked on safety and had our first challenge this week. 
            Through safety, we learned about OSHA, and dfferent safety requirements that are needed to go into a career with engineering.
            Our first challenge for the year was to transport a marble from one spot to another with some halved PVC pipes. The rules were that we couldn't
            touch the marble, send it back (on the pipes) and that everyone had to move the marble once (on the pipes). We achieved it by rolling the marble
            slowly across the pipes, and by occasionally slowing it down with a slight incline on the pipes. It wasn't exactly a hard challenge (considering it was
            our first one), so we managed to do it with relative ease.
