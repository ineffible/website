 8/21-8/24: Week 1
  We worked on safety and had our first challenge this week. 
            Through safety, we learned about OSHA, and dfferent safety requirements that are needed to go into a career with engineering.
            Our first challenge for the year was to transport a marble from one spot to another with some halved PVC pipes. The rules were that we couldn't
            touch the marble, send it back (on the pipes) and that everyone had to move the marble once (on the pipes). We achieved it by rolling the marble
            slowly across the pipes, and by occasionally slowing it down with a slight incline on the pipes. It wasn't exactly a hard challenge (considering it was
            our first one), so we managed to do it with relative ease. <br>

 8/28-9/1: Week 2
            This week, we started work on the Tinkercad software. We also started work on our Ruth Goldberg machines, mainly sketching out a basic plan, and
            creating a model on Tinkercad. 
            This week, our challenge was to create a 3D model of a household object, such as a remote control, a couch, or a microwave. I created a bookshelf on 
            Tinkercad, although I didn't manage to completely fill it with books. In my personal opinion, the challenge wasn't exactly that hard. <br>

 9/5-9/8: Week 3 
        We've officially started work on our Ruth Goldberg machines! We also finalized the model's design on Tinkercad.
        Although our group shrank in size, my partner and I are confident in our abilities to finish our machine in the time we were given to. So far, we've
        managed to create a foundation, and start work on the pulley system. We're planning to alter our design as necessary to complete our project realistically, 
        however. <br>

9/11-9/15: Week 4 
        Work on the Ruth Goldberg project has concluded. That was all we worked on this week (no challenge or anything - unfortunate). 
        My partner and I managed to complete the pulley system, add in the ramps and lever, and have multiple test runs completed. The challenging part of it,
        however, was getting the needle to stay in the right spot. The end goal of our machine had been to pop a balloon with a needle, which refused to stay
        in the right spot. We used a large amount of duct tape to get it to stay, and in our final run, we managed to pop said balloon successfully. <br>
