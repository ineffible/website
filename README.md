8/21-8/24: Week 1 <br>
  We worked on safety and had our first challenge this week. 
            Through safety, we learned about OSHA, and dfferent safety requirements that are needed to go into a career with engineering.
            Our first challenge for the year was to transport a marble from one spot to another with some halved PVC pipes. The rules were that we couldn't
            touch the marble, send it back (on the pipes) and that everyone had to move the marble once (on the pipes). We achieved it by rolling the marble
            slowly across the pipes, and by occasionally slowing it down with a slight incline on the pipes. It wasn't exactly a hard challenge (considering it was
            our first one), so we managed to do it with relative ease. <br>

<p align="center">
 8/28-9/1: Week 2 <br>
            This week, we started work on the Tinkercad software. We also started work on our Ruth Goldberg machines, mainly sketching out a basic plan, and
            creating a model on Tinkercad. 
            This week, our challenge was to create a 3D model of a household object, such as a remote control, a couch, or a microwave. I created a bookshelf on 
            Tinkercad, although I didn't manage to completely fill it with books. In my personal opinion, the challenge wasn't exactly that hard. <br>
</p>

<p align="center">
 9/5-9/8: Week 3 <br>
        We've officially started work on our Ruth Goldberg machines! We also finalized the model's design on Tinkercad.
        Although our group shrank in size, my partner and I are confident in our abilities to finish our machine in the time we were given to. So far, we've
        managed to create a foundation, and start work on the pulley system. We're planning to alter our design as necessary to complete our project realistically, 
        however. <br>

<p align="center">
9/11-9/15: Week 4 <br>
        Work on the Ruth Goldberg project has concluded. That was all we worked on this week (no challenge or anything - unfortunate). 
        My partner and I managed to complete the pulley system, add in the ramps and lever, and have multiple test runs completed. The challenging part of it,
        however, was getting the needle to stay in the right spot. The end goal of our machine had been to pop a balloon with a needle, which refused to stay
        in the right spot. We used a large amount of duct tape to get it to stay, and in our final run, we managed to pop said balloon successfully. <br>

  9/18-9/22: Week 5 <br>
       We worked on two projects this week. First was a floatation device, used to hold weights for up to 5 minutes. The second was designing an "E" and having someone else fabricate it. For the first project, the floatation device, I built a small raft with air pockets in parts of it to help it float. My plan was to put approximately 334 grams of weight atop it, but the raft flipped over after I put the weights on it. For the second challenge, the "E", I designed an E with as many measurements as I deemed neseccary. However, when I got another person's design, they hadn't put in enough effort for me to actually create an E. I had four lines on the paper, which didn't even make a box. We also learned about Computer Engineering which was (sadly) not of much interest to me. <br>
</p>

<p  align="center">
9/25-9/29: Week 6 <br>
       This week, we dissected a computer and learned the parts of it. My partner and I were quite efficient with the disassembly, so we went a bit further with our "destruction". Meaning we took apart the disk drive as well as the hard drive. Some of the parts we took out were the RAM, CPU, heatsink, fan, and much more. We then had to reassemble it, with minor difficulty due to the fact that neither of us knew what cords went where. We did manage to successfully put it back together, however, and when plugged into a monitor, the computer worked.
</p>

   ![PXL_20230926_203311167](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/383526ae-87ce-4eeb-9b8b-8fa1eb651b52)

<p align="center">
10/2-10/6: Week 7 <br>
      We went over bioengineering, specifically looking at prosthetic limbs. One of our challenges was to design and make a hand out of cardboard, that could pick up an empty waterbottle. My partner and I managed to do it with relative ease, using string to close the fingers and rubber bands on the fingertips for grip. We then had another challenge later on, which was to design a prosthetic limb for an animal of our choice. I decided to make a prosthetic dorsal fin for a shark. It looked relatively similiar to how an actual fin would've looked in shape, however it may have been relatively complicated for figure out the proper material for it.

<p align="center">
10/9-10/13: Week 8 <br>
      For this week, we went over Aerospace Engineering, which was a very interesting topic. Aerospace Engineering focuses on rockets and planes, so our challenge was to create a bottle airplane or rocket out of a 2L coke bottle. We were to create them on Tinkercad, however. As I was at home, I completed the challenge with relative ease. My design is of a rocket, it is incredibly simple though. <br>
</p>  
![bottle rocket2 0](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/3065817e-48cf-4fc2-a157-55e22a49a468) <br>

<p align="center">
10/16-10/20: Week 9 <br>
      This week, we continued our Aerospace Engineering unit through the creation and testing of a bottle plane/rocket. My partner and I's design was quite simple, with just wings, a fin, and a cone. Said rocket was filled with about half a cup of water, and pressurized to fourty psi. Then, we launched it twice, as the first time it got stuck on the launch pad. The second time it didn't go very far, although it did go. If we had been able to go again, I think we would've redesigned the plane to have a more rocket-like appearance, with large enough fins that it'd have enough spin to go far enough. I think we would also do a bit more pressure, so that it launches farther. <br>
</p>

<p align="center">
10/23-10/27: Week 10 <br>
      Our focus for this week was Environmental Engineering. We learned about the different types of it, such as water pollution focused, light and noise pollution focused, and air pollution focused. Our project was to create a filter and clean dirty water through it, in hopes of making it clear. My partner and I decided to do cotton balls on the bottom, a layer of sand,then pebbles, then rocks. After every other runthrough of the dirty water, we would clean our filter using clear water, and after a bit took out the pebbles and rocks. We managed to make our water incredibly clear, while many other groups had very yellow water. It was later revealed to us that our water was the clearest. <br>

<p align="center">
10/30-11/3: Week 11 <br>
      This week, we learned about Electrical Engineering. Many types of engineering use Electrical engineering, and in my opinion, so far it is the one I am most interested in. We had two labs this week, revolving around this type of engineering. Our goal was to use a tinkercad to turn a LED light on with a breadboard. While it was a bit of a challenge, once it was completed it made sense. We also filled out a worksheet about Ohm's law, which was relatively simple, although a bit confusing.
</p>

<p align="center">
11/6-11/9: Week 12 <br>
      We continued on Electrical Engineering this week, taking it a step further with using actual breadboards. We had a few labs revolving around this, like turning on multiple LEDs with only one resistor, or using and Arduino to make the LED blink. The Aduino bit was an amount more challenging, however, as the website didn't work properly. I managed to get the three LEDs to blink, however I couldn't get them to change sequence. The breadboard was a bit complicated, but I managed to work it out okay.

<p align="center">
11/13-11/17: Week 13 <br>
       Business engineering was the main focus of this week's lecture. The area focuses on the logistics of creating, manufacturing, and selling a product. We also began to brainstorm for our project, which is based off of the show, "Sharktank". My group does not currently have a finalized plan, but I am hoping that after the break we will come up with something. We watched a few minutes of a few projects that were broadcasted on the show, such as the Scrub Daddy, and some kind of lock.
</p>

![SS_16_ScrubDaddy_R081716_1200](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/2fb9155f-449e-4e4f-9afa-b00da01f70c0)

<p align="center">
11/27-12/1: Week 14 <br>
      We presented our Sharktank product, the PinMaster Pro. It's used to measure the distance between two pins wirelessly, and the distance is read on a small screen. Our presentation covered pricing, our selling point, custumors, and the amount of money were asking for. I think it went pretty well, although another group had a very similar idea. The most pitch made by my classmates was definitely the ScrubDoggy, which was a byproduct of the ScrubDaddy, but made to clean dogs.

<p align="center">
12/4-12/20: Week 15 <br>
      Our final project for the semester was to make two bridges out of pasta and glue, and to be able to support a bucket of water with it. My group split into two groups to complete the task.
<ol type="1">
  <li> The bridge my partner and I worked on weighed 100 grams. It was the heaviest bridge out of the class. </li>
  <li> It held about 4000 grams of water. My partner and I are pretty sure it could've held more, however the bucket was out of space. It held the most water out of the whole class, however. </li>
  <li> The ratio of bridge to water was for every 40 grams of water, there was one gram of bridge. 40:1. </li>
  <li> The heaviest part of the bridge was likely the glue holding it all together, which contributed to the main weight. The actual pasta didn't weigh much. </li>
  <li> The design of our bridge was inspired by a truss bridge, which are strong because of how the triangles work. </li>
  <li> Our design worked a bit better than we thought it would, as my partner and I were worried it would break apart due to how the glue was. Parts of the glue were wet while we were testing, which wasn't ideal.</li>
  <li> There wasn't really a point of failure to the bridge. The only reason we really stopped was because the bucket couldn't hold anymore water. However, the sides did start to crumble under where we were holding it.</li>
  <li> To improve the bridge, next time it may be beneficial to have more pasta, so that we don't have to conserve as much. It also wouldv've been good to have more time. </li>
</ol> </p>

SEMESTER 2
</p>

<p align="center">
S2 Week 1: 1/8-1/12
        This week our focus was chemical engineering. We learned about mass production of chemical products, and about how important it is to balance mixtures properly. Based around that, our project was to make Oobleck without a recipe. Oobleck is a liquid, that when struck at a high force, turns solid. It's made with corn starch and water, however we weren't given a recipe, and had to guess. Our mixture turned out well.
</p>

<p align="center">
S2 Week 2: 1/15-1/19 <br>
        This week, we started work on our project. We are creating mousetrap or arduino cars. My partner and I decided to create an arduino car, so we began work on our project proposal. We researched prices, and different ideas for coding and looks for the car. We also watched a video on the mousetrap car, where we learned that if we were to do a mousetrap car, we'd want it to go as slow as possible to gain the most distance.

<p align="center">
S2 Week 3: 1/22-1/26 <br>
        We continued work on arduino cars this week. Starting with, we created the Tinkercad, and then began work on the actual code and car. The code is not working so far, but we think we'll be able to get it to. That's our goal for this week, as well as finishing the base build of the car. We are also hoping to get the car to move an amount.
</p>

![Screenshot 2024-01-23 2 24 09 PM](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/c97a5f2b-d1af-4fb2-9037-b9e515ee098a)

<p align="center">
  S2 Week 4: 1/29-2/2 <br>
          Continuing on the cars, we are still creating the code. We have run into several problems, one being that half the time the code doesn't work. We will continue to work on it through next week, and start work on the body. When the code does work, much of the time it doesn't follow exactly what we put in. We're hoping to be done with the code in a week or so.
</p>

![1129065663881t](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/b656b063-65c8-41d8-bc0d-437237108db6)

<p align="center">
  S2 Week 5: 2/5-2/9 <br>
          We continued to work on our arduino car. We started work on the body, although we didn't get much done. Still having problems with the code, we found a few different ones to try out. None worked, so we will be continuing to try new ones and edit the old one until it works. We are hoping to finish the body next week, and be completely done with the code.
</p>

![Screenshot 2024-02-13 2 15 07 PM](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/ee95cb5e-4478-4f4b-bfb6-de1d27d4c11c)

<p align="center">
  S2 Week 6: 2/12-2/16 <br>
          We managed to figure out why our car doesn't work, our motor being the problem. We ended up rewiring the car, and made minor changes to the code. We also resautered a wheel (several times). We're hoping to be completely finished with the car next week. We have most of the body done, as well.

<p align="center">
  S2 Week 7: 2/19-2/23 <br>
           This week, we tested our car. It went relatively well, although the main thing our car did was go in circles. If we had more time, I believe my partner and I could've improved on both the body and the coding. The body we would've fleshed out more, and made into an actual design. For the code, we could've figured out how to make the car follow an actual path.
           </p>

<p align="center">
  S2 Week 8: 2/26-3/1 <br>
          We began work on our next project, the egg drop challenge. The goal is to drop an egg inside of some kind of protective material and have the egg survive. My partner and I began research by studying an egg, and figuring out the best way to protect it. We plan to make a small box, padded with cotton, and with a parachute attached to slow the fall. We also did a mini challenge, doors vs wheels. We were assigned to wheels, and had to count the amount of wheels in the school. We found that hinges counted as wheels, along with sewing bobbins, and many other things. 
          </p>

![Screenshot 2024-03-04 1 54 14 PM](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/30aebeba-43cd-414a-be12-4defb1ec5a7d)

<p align="center">
   S2 Week 9: 3/4-3/8 <br>
        For our egg drop machine, we made a small box, and created some kind of webbing inside it. We then surrounded that with cottonballs we unrolled, and created a large parachute to slow the fall. For the last day of building, we plan to finish the webbing, and do a few more test runs. We also did the flying paper challenge, which I created a paper airplane for. It went pretty far, but was not the farthest.
</p>


<p align="center">
  S2 Week 10: 3/11-3/15 <br>
       I was not here this week, so my partner was in charge of the egg drop. For the challenge, our parachute greatly slowed the device, so the egg did not break! Had we more time, we're not quite sure what we would add, although we may have tried to clean up the design a bit. I was not here for the other challenge, so I cannot make comments on how it went.
</p>


<p align-"center">
  S2 Week 11: 3/25-3/29 <br>
        This week, we started work on another project, creating a boat to move quickly down a rain gutter. Our design is a waterbottle with a sail, although we ran into some problems with the sail. The original plan was with a water balloon, but it was too small, so currently in use is a piece of paper made into a cone. We also plan on powering it with wind power and a hand-held fan. For the boat, the width had to be less than 8 cm, so we've had some minor problems when it came to that.
</p>

  ![Screenshot 2024-04-01 1 30 21 PM](https://github.com/ineffible/website/assets/142843884/c2bffd38-7078-435f-807b-ffc5bf0d0a31)


<p align-"center">
  S2 Week 12: 4/1-4/5 <br>
          This week, we finalized the design of our boat, and tested. We had to add something to stabilize the boat in the water, so we cut up a straw and taped it to the bottom so that it would stay upright. Our testing went badly, however, because the boat still wouldn't stay upright. We did not make it to the end, however the use of the fan did get us higher points. If we could've redone the project, I think we would've figured out how to make our boat stay upright, and make our sail much, much better. We also could've increased the size of the fan. I learned that while the design may seem good, there is always more to improve on.
</p>

<p align-"center">
S2 Week 13: 4/8-4/12 <br>
          This week, we started out by working on the TinkerCAD for our next project, which will be a cardboard boat that will have two people in it, and be paddled across a pool. My design, as we have not started working with partners just yet, is similar to that of a canoe, so it hopefully will be fast enough to come in first place. The rest of class we spent working on a mini-project, on who could make the longest bridge out of just sticky-notes. Our bridge was estimated to be about 570", as we cut each sticky note into 24 pieces, and stuck them together about 1/4" layered. Unfortunately I did miss the testing of the bridge, as I had to get to my next class, but I heard that it fell apart :(
